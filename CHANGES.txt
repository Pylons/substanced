Next release
------------

- Rely on at least Pyramid 1.5+.  Compatibility with Pyramid 2.X.

- Replace virtualenv with tox as a testing extra.

- Remove support for Python 2.6, 3.2, and 3.3, and add support for Python 3.5.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/substanced/pull/264

- Omit the ``Upload`` tab for folders which can not contain files. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/substanced/pull/247.

- Added Finnish translation.

- Fixed bug in scaffold that prevented Document properties tab from showing up
  in the SDI.

- ``substanced.file.FileUploadPropertySheet`` (which backs the File->Upload
  property tab) did not properly clear tempfiles from the upload tmpdir.

- ``substanced.file.views.AddFileView`` (which backs the Add -> File form in
  the SDI) did not properly clear tempfiles from the upload tmpdir.

- Changing a NameSchemaNode property via a propertysheet view (ie.
  changing the name of an item in a folder via its propertysheet)
  would fail with an exception if the name you chose was already
  used within the folder.  It now shows a flash message and prevents
  the change.

- Removed Python 2.6 compatibility shim ``substanced._compat.total_ordering``.
