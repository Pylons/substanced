Substance D
===========

Overview
--------

Substance D is an application server built using the :term:`Pyramid` web
framework. It can be used as a base to build a general-purpose web application
like a blog, a shopping cart application, a scheduling application, or any
other web app that requires both an administration and a retail interface.

Substance D owes much of its spirit to the :term:`Zope` application server.

It requires Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2 or 3.3.

Installation
------------

Install using setuptools, e.g. (within a virtualenv)::

  $ easy_install substanced

.. warning:: 

   During Substance D's pre-alpha period, it may be necessary to use a checkout
   of Substance D as well as checkouts of the most recent versions of the
   libraries upon which Substance D depends.

Optional Dependencies
---------------------

Use of the :py:attr:`substanced.file.USE_MAGIC`
constant for guessing file types
from stream content requires the ``python-magic`` library, which works without
extra help on Linux systems, but requires special dependency installations on
Mac OS and Windows systems.  You'll need to follow these steps on those
platforms to use this feature:

Mac OS X

Windows

  "Installation on Win32" in https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic

Demonstration Application
--------------------------

See the application running at http://demo.substanced.net for a demonstration
of the Substance D management interface. 

To deploy the demo locally, run ``pcreate -s substanced myproj`` after 
installing Substance D. That creates a ``myproj`` directory and installs
the ``substanced`` scaffold in it. To run it, change into ``mpyproj`` and
execute ``pserve development.ini``. The development server listens to 
requests sent to ``http://0.0.0.0:6543`` by default.
