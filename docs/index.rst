Substance D
===========

Overview
--------

Substance D is an application server built using the :term:`Pyramid` web
framework. It can be used as a base to build a general-purpose web application
like a blog, a shopping cart application, a scheduling application, or any
other web app that requires both an administration and a retail interface.

Substance D owes much of its spirit to the :term:`Zope` application server.

It requires Python 2.7, 3.4, or 3.5.

Installation
------------
See :doc:`install`.

Demonstration Application
-------------------------

See the application running at http://demo.substanced.net for a demonstration
of the Substance D management interface.
