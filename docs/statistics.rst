Gathering Runtime Statistics
============================

Problems can come up in production. When they do, you usually want
forensics that show aspects of the system under load,
over a period of time.

Of course, you don't want the collection of such data to affect
performance. What's needed is a mechanism to log data all the time,
in a lightweight way, that can later be analyzed in productive ways.
This system needs both built-in hooks at the Substance D framework
level as well as extension points to analyze function points in the
application you are writing.

Three components are involved in the process of collecting statistics:

- :mod:`substanced.stats` exposes Python API to collect data and sends it to
  to `StatsD <https://github.com/etsy/statsd>` agent
- StatsD agent aggregates data and sends it to backend service
- Backend service displays graphs based on stored data. Can be self-hosted such
  as `Graphite http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/<>`_ or SaaS solution as
  `DataDog <http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`


Setting Up
----------

To enable statistics gathering in your site, edit your ``.ini`` configuration
file and add the following lines to your ``[app:main]`` section::

    substanced.statsd.enabled = true
    substanced.statsd.host = localhost
    substanced.statsd.port = 8125
    substanced.statsd.prefix = substanced


Using DataDog with SubstanceD statistics
****************************************

Substance D supports `DataDog <http://www.datadoghq.com/>`_,
a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provider for monitoring and visualizing
performance data. DataDog installs an `dogstatsd` agent for sending custom metrics
on your local system. The agent is based on `StatsD <https://github.com/etsy/statsd>`_.

`Sign up for an account with DataDog <https://www.datadoghq.com/signup/>`_.
This will provide you with the instructions for downloading and running the local agent.

Once you log into your DataDog dashboard, click on ``Infrastructure``
and you'll see any hosts configured as part of your account:

.. image:: images/datadog1.png

The ``substanced`` entry in ``Apps`` table column is from the
``substanced.statsd.prefix`` configured in `Settings up` section. 
Clicking on that brings up Substance D specific monitoring in DataDog:

Clicking settings symbol on a graph will lead you to graph editor, where
you can change how DataDog interprets and renders your graphs. A good resource
how the editor works is `Graphing Primer <http://docs.datadoghq.com/graphing/#editor>`_. 

DataDog also supports `Metric Alerts <https://app.datadoghq.com/alerts>`_ allowing you
to send alerts when your statistics reach certain state.


Logging Custom Statistics
=========================

Over time, Substance D itself will include more framework points where
statistics are collected. Most likely, though, you'll want some
statistics that are very meaningful to your application's specific
functionality.

If you look at the docs for the
`Python statsd
module <http://statsd.readthedocs.org/en/v0.5.0/types.html>`_ you will
see three main types:

- *Counters* for simply incrementing a value,

- *Timers* for logging elapsed time in a code block, and

- *Gauges* for tracking a constant at a particular point in time

Each of these map to methods in
:py:class:`substanced.stats.StatsdHelper`. This class is available as
an instance available via import:

.. code-block:: python

    from substanced.stats import statsd_gauge

Your application code can then make calls to these stats-gathering
methods. For example, :py:class:`substanced.principal.User` does the
following to note that check password was used:

.. code-block:: python

    statsd_gauge('check_password', 1)

Here is an example in
:py:meth:`substanced.catalog.Catalog.index_resource` that measures
elapsed indexing time inside a Python ``with`` block:

.. code-block:: python

    with statsd_timer('catalog.index_resource'):
        if oid is None:
            oid = oid_from_resource(resource)
        for index in self.values():
            index.index_resource(resource, oid=oid, action_mode=action_mode)
        self.objectids.insert(oid)
