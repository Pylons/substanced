   Pyramid
      A `web framework <http://pylonsproject.org>`_.

   Resource
     An object representing a node in the :term:`resource tree` of your
     Substance D application. A resource becomes the :term:`context` of a
     :term:`view` when someone visits a URL in your application.

   Resource tree
     A nested set of :term:`folder` objects and other kinds of content
     objects, each of which is a :term:`resource`.  Your content objects are
     laid out hierarchically in the resource tree as they're added.

   Folder
     A resource object which contains other resource objects.  See
     :class:`substanced.folder.Folder`.

   Content
     A :term:`resource` which is particularly well-behaved when viewed via
     the Substance D management interface.

   SDI
     An acronym for the "Substance D (Management) Interface".  What you see
     when you visit ``/manage``.

   Resource factory
     An object which creates a :term:`resource` when it's called.  It's often
     just a class that implements the resource itself.

   Content type
     An :term:`interface` associated with a particular kind of content
     object.  A content type also has metadata like an icon, an add view
     name, and other things.

   Management view
     A :term:`view configuration` that is only invoked when a user visits a
     URL prepended with the :term:`manage prefix`.

   Manage prefix
     The prepended portion of the URL (usually ``/manage``) which signifies
     that view lookup should be done only amongst the set of views registered
     as :term:`management view` types.  This can be changed by setting the
     ``substanced.manage_prefix`` key in your ``development.ini`` or
     ``production.ini`` configuration files.

   JSON API view
     A :term:`view configuration` that is only invoked when a user visits a
     URL prepended with the :term:`JSON API prefix`.

   JSON API prefix
     The prepended portion of the URL (usually ``/api``) which signifies
     that view lookup should be done only amongst the set of views registered
     as :term:`JSON API view` types.  This can be changed by setting the
     ``substanced.api_prefix`` key in your ``development.ini`` or
     ``production.ini`` configuration files.

   Service
     A persistent object in the :term:`resource tree` that exposes an API to
     application developers.  For example, the ``principals`` service.

   Deform
     A form library that draws and validates forms based on :term:`Colander`
     schemas.  See http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/deform/en/latest/
     for more information.

   Colander
     A schema library which can be used used to describe arbitrary data
     structures.  See
     http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/colander/en/latest/ for more
     information.

   Object Map Reference
     A relationship kept in the :term:`object map` between two persistent
     objects.  It is composed of a source, some number of targets, and a
     :term:`reference type`.

   Reference Type
     A hashable object describing the type of relationship between two
     objects in the :term:`object map`.  It's usually a string.

   Object Map
     A Substance D :term:`service` which maps the object IDs of persistent
     objects to paths and object IDs to other object IDs in the system.

   Service
     A Substance D content object which provides a service to application code
     (such as a catalog or a principals service).

   Global Object
     A Python object that can be obtained via an ``import`` statement.

   Factory Wrapper
     A function that wraps a content factory when the content factory is not
     a class or when a ``factory_name`` is used within the content type
     declaration.

   Zope
     An application server from which much of the spirit of Substance D is
     derived.  See http://zope.org.

   DataDog
     A Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provider for monitoring and visualizing
     performance data that is compatible with the ``statsd`` statistics output
     channel used by Substance D.  See http://www.datadoghq.com
